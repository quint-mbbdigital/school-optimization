# Rapid Prototyping Plan: School Performance Dashboard on Replit

## 1. Set Up the Replit Project (30 minutes)

1. Go to Replit.com and sign up/log in
2. Create a new Repl, choosing "Node.js" as the language
3. Name your project (e.g., "school-performance-dashboard")

## 2. Set Up the Backend (2 hours)

1. In the main `index.js` file, set up a basic Express server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('School Performance Dashboard API');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

2. Create a `data` folder and add JSON files for mock data (e.g., `schools.json`, `performance.json`)
3. Create API routes to serve this mock data

## 3. Create a Simple Frontend (3 hours)

1. In the Replit sidebar, create a new file called `index.html`
2. Set up a basic HTML structure with a `<div id="root"></div>`
3. Add React and ReactDOM from a CDN in the `<head>`
4. Create a `script.js` file for your React components
5. In `index.js`, add middleware to serve static files:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

## 4. Develop Key Components (4 hours)

In `script.js`, create React components for:

1. Main dashboard overview
2. Performance timeline (simplified version)
3. School comparison tool (basic version)

Use the Recharts library (add via CDN) for data visualization.

## 5. Implement Data Fetching (2 hours)

1. Use the `fetch` API in your React components to get data from your Express backend
2. Implement basic error handling and loading states

## 6. Add Interactivity (2 hours)

1. Implement click events for drilling down into data
2. Add a simple form for filtering or searching schools

## 7. Style Your Application (2 hours)

1. Add a CSS file and link it in your HTML
2. Implement a basic responsive layout
3. Style your components for improved readability

## 8. Testing and Refinement (2 hours)

1. Manually test all features
2. Refine UI/UX based on testing
3. Optimize performance if needed

## 9. Documentation (1 hour)

1. Update the README.md file with:
   - Project description
   - Setup instructions
   - Usage guide

## 10. Share Your Prototype (30 minutes)

1. Ensure your Repl is set to "Public"
2. Use Replit's "Invite" feature to share with collaborators
3. Use the Replit URL to showcase your prototype

Total Estimated Time: 19 hours (2-3 days of focused work)

## Additional Tips for Replit

1. Use the Replit Database for simple data storage if needed
2. Leverage Replit's "Always On" feature to keep your app running
3. Use the built-in version control to track changes
4. Utilize Replit's multiplayer feature for real-time collaboration

This plan provides a streamlined approach to quickly prototype your school performance dashboard. While it won't have all the features of the full application, it will allow you to test core concepts and gather feedback rapidly.
