### Phase 4: Frontend Development (6 weeks)
1. Set up frontend development environment
2. Develop reusable UI components
3. Implement main dashboard views
4. Create interactive data visualization components
5. Develop user authentication and profile management interfaces

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (3 weeks)
1. Integrate frontend with backend services
2. Perform unit testing for individual components
3. Conduct integration testing
4. Perform user acceptance testing (UAT)
5. Optimize performance and resolve any identified issues

### Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment (2 weeks)
1. Create user documentation
2. Prepare technical documentation
3. Set up deployment environment
4. Deploy the application
5. Conduct final testing in the production environment

### Phase 7: Project Closure (1 week)
1. Conduct project review meeting
2. Gather feedback from stakeholders
3. Document lessons learned
4. Formalize project closure

Total estimated time: 21 weeks (about 5 months)

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Technology**: React.js
- **Key Components**:
  - User Interface (UI) components
  - State management (Redux or Context API)
  - Routing (React Router)
  - Data visualization libraries (D3.js, Recharts)
  - API integration (Axios or Fetch API)

### 2. Backend Layer
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Key Components**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Authentication middleware (JWT)
  - Data processing services
  - Caching layer (Redis)

### 3. Database Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Stores structured data (school info, performance metrics, etc.)
- **Cache Database**: Redis
  - Caches frequently accessed data for improved performance

### 4. Data Processing Layer
- **Technology**: Python
- **Key Components**:
  - Data analysis scripts (NumPy, Pandas)
  - Machine learning models for predictive analytics (Scikit-learn)
  - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes

### 5. Authentication and Authorization
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization

### 6. External Services Integration
- APIs for fetching external data (e.g., district/state averages)
- Integration with notification services (e.g., email, SMS)

### 7. DevOps and Deployment
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes for orchestration
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS or Google Cloud Platform

### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- Application monitoring: Prometheus
- Log management: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### 9. Security
- SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
- Data encryption at rest
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Data Flow

1. Mock data is generated and stored in the PostgreSQL database.
2. The backend server retrieves data from the database as needed.
3. Frequently accessed data is cached in Redis for quick retrieval.
4. The backend processes requests, performs necessary computations, and sends responses to the frontend.
5. The frontend renders the data and handles user interactions.
6. User actions that require data updates are sent to the backend, which updates the database accordingly.

## Scalability Considerations

- Implement horizontal scaling for the backend servers.
- Use load balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
- Optimize database queries and implement database sharding if needed.
- Utilize content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets.

This architecture provides a robust foundation for building a scalable and maintainable school performance dashboard. It separates concerns between different layers, allows for easy scaling of individual components, and provides a clear data flow through the system.
