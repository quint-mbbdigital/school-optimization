# User Testing Plan: School Performance Dashboard

## 1. Objectives

- Validate the usability and effectiveness of the dashboard's key features
- Identify any pain points or areas of confusion in the user interface
- Gather feedback on the utility and relevance of the data presented
- Assess the intuitiveness of data visualization components
- Evaluate the overall user experience and satisfaction

## 2. Participant Selection

### Target User Groups:
1. School Administrators
2. Teachers
3. District-level Education Officials
4. Policy Makers
5. Data Analysts in Education

### Selection Criteria:
- Varied levels of technical proficiency
- Mix of experience with similar dashboards
- Diverse demographic representation
- Range of school types (public, charter, private)

### Number of Participants:
- Aim for 5-8 participants per user group
- Total of 25-40 participants

## 3. Testing Methodology

### 3.1 Usability Testing Sessions
- **Format**: One-on-one sessions, either in-person or via video call
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session
- **Moderation**: Conducted by a UX researcher or trained team member
- **Recording**: Screen and audio recording (with participant consent)

### 3.2 Task Scenarios
1. Log in and interpret the main dashboard
2. Explore the performance timeline for a specific school
3. Compare performance metrics between two schools
4. Analyze resource allocation and suggest reallocation
5. Use predictive tools to forecast future performance
6. Identify significant events impacting school performance
7. Generate a report based on the dashboard data

### 3.3 Think-Aloud Protocol
- Participants verbalize their thoughts, actions, and feelings while completing tasks

### 3.4 Post-Task Questionnaires
- Short questionnaires after each task to assess ease of use and task completion success

### 3.5 System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Standardized questionnaire to measure overall usability

## 4. Test Environment Setup

### 4.1 Testing Platform
- Fully functional prototype of the dashboard
- Populated with realistic mock data

### 4.2 Testing Devices
- Desktop computers (various screen sizes)
- Tablets (for testing responsive design)
- Ensure consistent browser versions across devices

### 4.3 Additional Tools
- Eye-tracking software (if available) to analyze user focus areas
- Heat mapping tools to visualize interaction patterns

## 5. Data Collection Methods

1. Task completion rates and times
2. Error rates and types
3. Verbal feedback (think-aloud protocol)
4. Non-verbal cues (facial expressions, body language)
5. Post-task questionnaire responses
6. System Usability Scale (SUS) scores
7. Open-ended feedback and suggestions

## 6. Testing Schedule

### Week 1-2: Preparation
- Finalize test scenarios and questionnaires
- Recruit participants
- Set up testing environment

### Week 3-5: Conduct Testing Sessions
- Run 5-8 sessions per week
- Daily debriefs to discuss initial findings

### Week 6: Analysis and Reporting
- Analyze collected data
- Prepare preliminary findings report

## 7. Analysis and Reporting

### 7.1 Quantitative Analysis
- Task completion rates and times
- Error rates
- SUS scores
- Satisfaction ratings from questionnaires

### 7.2 Qualitative Analysis
- Thematic analysis of verbal feedback
- Identification of common pain points and praised features
- Synthesis of user suggestions and expectations

### 7.3 Reporting
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings report
- Prioritized list of usability issues
- Recommendations for improvements
- Visual aids (charts, heat maps, user journey maps)

## 8. Ethical Considerations

- Obtain informed consent from all participants
- Ensure data privacy and anonymity in reporting
- Provide clear instructions on how to withdraw from the study
- Offer compensation for participants' time (e.g., gift cards)

## 9. Accessibility Testing

- Include participants with disabilities (e.g., visual impairments)
- Test with assistive technologies (screen readers, etc.)
- Evaluate compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines

## 10. Follow-up and Iteration

- Plan for follow-up testing after implementing changes
- Consider A/B testing for significant design decisions
- Establish a process for continuous user feedback collection
